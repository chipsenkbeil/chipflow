# ChipFlow

A self-hosted kanban board inspired by KanbanFlow, with pomodoro-sized task
cards, WIP limits, swimlanes, and a full pomodoro timer: ding + browser
notification when a session ends, overtime counting, per-task pomodori and
interruption tracking, and a "why did you stop?" menu when you bail early.

Pure Rust, one static binary, one database file. No Docker needed.

## Quickstart

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/chipflow
chipflow
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — the setup page creates your admin account on
first run (the argon2 hash is stored in the database; the password itself
is never kept).

Configuration: flags or the matching environment variables. Everything has
a sane default, so bare `chipflow` just works.

- `--port` / `PORT` — HTTP port (default: `3000`).
- `--database-path` / `DATABASE_PATH` — database file
  (default: `~/.local/share/chipflow/chipflow.redb`, honoring `XDG_DATA_HOME`).

## Development

```sh
cargo run
```

Requires Rust 1.70+ (edition 2021). Release builds embed the web assets, so
the installed binary needs nothing next to it.

## Using it

- Drag cards between columns and swimlanes; dropping into **Done** stamps the
  completion date (grouped under Today / Yesterday / date), dragging out
  clears it. The **In progress** header turns amber at its WIP limit of 3.
- Columns and swimlanes are fully customizable at runtime: add, rename,
  reorder, delete, and set/clear WIP limits from the board.
- Click a card to open its detail modal: edit name/description, pick a
  pomodoro size (card color follows), see time spent / pomodori completed /
  interruptions, and log time manually. The rail on the right starts a
  Pomodoro or Stopwatch and jumps to the time log.
- The header timer pill tracks the active session across page loads: click it
  for the timer popup (today's sessions, add time, log, settings). Stopping a
  pomodoro early asks why; sessions under 20 seconds are discarded.
- The gear opens **Settings**: pomodoro/short-break/long-break lengths, ding
  and notification toggles, and the interruption-reason list.
- Card colors encode size: 1 pomodoro = yellow, 2 = green, 3 = blue,
  >3 = red.
